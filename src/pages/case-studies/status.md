## Case Study

### The Company

Founded by former Citi & Goldman Sachs data scientists, Status Money is a tech company whose mission is to bring the big-data capabilities of Wall Street to everyone. Conceived of initially as a PMF (personal-finance management) web application, it has evolved into a suite of tools and services to help people manage their money.

### The Design Team

Just Me

- reporting to the CEO + Founder.
- Working very closely with the front-end team

### Types of products I've designed and launched with Status

- A responsive web-app
- Native iOS and Android versions of the web-app
- A marketing site for the company
- A company blog
- A chrome extension
- A video meeting tool
- A social network
- A COVID economic dashboard
- And more...

> Everything was designed to be responsive across multilple devices and screen sizes.

### My approach

- Research a feature
- Create initial exploratory wirefreames/mockups to help set on a design direction
- Create iterations based on the selected direction with a new set of options and directions within the constraints set by the previous stages of design.

  - 'version control' in figma know what was tried thanks to an ability to go back and see iterations and old ideas

- Iterate over this process with 0.1,0.2, 0.3 versions until a 1.0
  - get creative and cretea many iterations. select from the best when you see them side by side. Sometimes create unusable designs just to make sure you cover that ground and dont repeat yourself later.
- Start to focus in on a node and getting to the answer

Create diagram of a tree coming out to form the beginning idea.
fishing, castinga line out to an idea

Design challenge of desinging from scratch and starting from wireframes vs using components
