# UNICEF

## Case Study

### The Organization

UNICEF is one of the five core partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) working to eradicate polio from the three remaining countries in which it is endemic.

Besides their efforts.

Working alongside various NGOs and government. They track key indicators to monitor the eradication efforts in Nigeria, one of the three endemic countries (along with Pakistan and Afghanistan).

Innovation department to see how we could use technology to improve their efforts.

- unicef helps fight polio
- They track different indicators to guage their progress
- Tracking was being handled by custom dashboard.

### The Challenge

- As the situation changed, so did the requirements and so did the needs of the dashboard.
- I was brought on to help maintain this dashboard.
- We were constantly wasting time clarifying requirements back and forth across time zones and spending a lot of development time on work that was outdated within a few weeks.
- It quickly became clear that this would not scale

### The Solution

- My goal was to design something that would be powerful and simple enough to empower our end users to 'build' their own dashboards for any use case without any code.

#### My process on this project

1. Gain a deep understanding of the product, users, challenges and capabilities of the team to conceive of a solution.
   - Meet all the stakeholders involved
   - Talk with end-users
   - Become acquainted with the backend and tech stack
   - Become acquainted with and took ownership of the front-end
2. Identify any pain point and opportunities
3. Built a proof-of-concept prototype to get stakeholder buy-in
4. Get the prototype in front of end-users as soon as possible
5. Iterate based on user feedback and testing

### Details

**My approach was two-fold:**

##### Visualize a dataset

Create a Chart Designer that could visualize almost any data fed into it in a variety of charts, tables and maps.

**Examples**

- Track the trend of infection numbers with a line chart
- Find the outbreak hotspots visually on a map

##### Save collections of visualizations

Create an interface that could combine these resulting Charts into custom dashboards that can be saved, modified and accessed in the future.

### Section 5 - Results

The dashboard builder went into production usage in the field. After several months of iteration and support, the product was officially handed off to the local team in Afghanistan who now maintain it.
