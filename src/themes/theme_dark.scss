// In this example, we're consuming each portion of EUI separately
// The advantage in this method is you can provide overwrites as you
// feel necessary. Each one of these imports could be further expanded
// into their parts if we wanted to do even more styling.
@import '~@elastic/eui/src/themes/eui/eui_colors_dark';
// @import '../node_modules/@elastic/eui/src/theme_dark.scss';

// Here we are overwriting the color from blue to pink
$euiColorPrimary: #00BFB3;

// Global styling, this is where things like shadows, borders
// and other mixin based helpers live
@import 'src/global_styling/index';


// This pulls in all the EUI component styling. If we wanted to
// style individual components, we could further break up this
// file into its parts.
@import '~@elastic/eui/src/components/index';


// We can now import stuff specific to the app, and it now will
// recieve the adjusted EUI takens and
@import 'src/components/index';
